Description: Diagnostic classification models (DCMs) can provide useful 
    information about students' strengths and weaknesses in an academic domain 
    beyond the norm-referenced or percentile results typically achieved through 
    item response theory. DCMs, however, need to be able to accommodate the 
    multilevel framework in which most education takes place, or they run the 
    risk of providing substantially inaccurate results. The purpose of this 
    project is to develop and make accessible to applied researchers a 
    multilevel extension to the longitudinal diagnostic classification model 
    (DCM) to help researchers take into account contextual effects that can 
    impact the fidelity and effectiveness of an educational intervention.
